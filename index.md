<hr/>

I have always been a lover of movement. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I was
hooked. I became a junkie. The more I moved, the more I wanted to move. What about you?

You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together, and maybe you can become a
junkie too.

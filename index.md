You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Bones for Life® Head to Toe, 4 Tuesdays in May with Liz Monnier

“To develop sight, we need to have light. To develop hearing, we need to have sounds. To develop the bones, we need confrontation with pressure. This pressure, like light and sound, is provided in the natural conditions of our everyday life. It is present in the way we bring the weight of the body to the ground in the springy and rhythmical pulsations of walking.” Ruthy Alon

This next segment “Head to Toe,” invites us to discover the relationships of the many skeletal components that allow us effortless movement particularly in standing and walking. If you are new to Bones for Life®, this is an excellent time to start! If you have taken classes, this segment provides an opportunity to revisit, refresh and upgrade your understanding and go deeper into the processes. Bones for Life® is designed to help anyone, and everyone, use natural movements to promote bone health and strength while possibly preventing osteoporosis. 
This series will require a wrap (7 yards by 40 inches of light cotton fabric.)

With simple and gentle instruction, Bones for Life® processes can also bring the following benefits: 

	Coordinates a springy and vibrant walk.
	Frees the joints from compromising habits allowing for pain free movement.
	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium. 
	Teaches you how to move your unique body in a range that is right for you. 
	Helps you to rediscover the pleasure of moving!

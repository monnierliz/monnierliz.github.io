You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Join a Class with Liz 

Self-Adjust, Self-Heal
A Bones for Life® four-class series with Liz Monnier
November 10, 17, December 1, 8
Thursdays 12:00 noon – 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) On Zoom
Can’t make this time? No worries, classes will be recorded and available for 2 weeks.
I hope you will join me as in closing out the year 2022 focusing on the power we have to tap into our body’s inner wisdom to heal ourselves. As we make small adjustments in our movement, we engage our innate intelligence. Adding to the basic Bones for Life® processes, we will encourage our nervous system with positive thinking, some new ways of breathing,  and mix it up with a little Qigong! As we improve the way we move, we improve the way we feel. 
With simple and gentle instruction, Bones for Life® processes can bring the following benefits: 

	Coordinates a springy and vibrant walk.
	Frees the joints from compromising habits allowing for pain free movement.
	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium. 
	Teaches you how to move your unique body in a range that is right for you. 
	Helps you to rediscover the pleasure of moving! 
Bones for Life® is designed to help anyone, and everyone, use natural movements to promote bone health and strength while possibly preventing osteoporosis. For more information check out this link: http://movementintelligence.org/bones-for-life

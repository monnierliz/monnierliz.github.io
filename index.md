You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

The weather is getting warmer and there is nothing better than taking a walk through the woods. But if our knees or hips are achy it’s not so much fun. These delicate joints must all be in harmony for a truly joyful walking experience. As our balance improves, we are simultaneously creating a more dynamic skeleton that is able to build more bone. We are aligning ourselves to create the domino effect of the ground force to travel all the up our spine. We don’t get this quality of movement from a pill or a doctor. We achieve it by being aware of our own movement. That is pretty magical! 

Improve bone health and strength with the gentle, natural movements guided by Liz Monnier.  Liz is a certified Bones for Life® instructor.  This practice has been shown to improve posture, decrease pain, and aid in the fight against osteoporosis.  While this class is most effective with movements involving standing, walking, sitting, and lying on the floor, movement may be modified to accommodate restrictions.  
Benefits from Bones for Life®:

	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium.

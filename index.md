You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Join a Class with Liz in person or on Zoom

Bones for Life® processes help us to understand more about ourselves. When we begin to pay attention to our movement and feel more aware, the brain and nervous system make positive changes that create more efficiency. Movement becomes easier and more enjoyable. I believe you will feel a difference.

You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Join a Class with Liz 

Finding your Footing
A Bones for Life® four-week series July 2022
Thursdays, 12 Noon -1:00 p.m. (EST) with Liz Monnier
 
One of the proven benefits of participating in a Bones for Life® program is an increase in self-confidence! Fear of falling is by far one of most devasting emotions that grabs a hold as we age. The fear-based approach is to hold on in order not to fall, to be careful, to go slowly and to avoid confrontation. In this way, the fear becomes more and more dominant. The Bones for Life® program provides an experience of a safe and reliable model of standing that offers an expanded potential for movement within maximum equilibrium. In order to gain balance, every part of the body needs to be finely tuned and in harmony with all the other parts. I hope you’ll join me in July as we explore and discover our self-reliance. For this series you will need a set of ankle weights.

With simple and gentle instruction, Bones for Life® processes can bring the following benefits: 

	Coordinates a springy and vibrant walk.
	Frees the joints from compromising habits allowing for pain free movement.
	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium. 
	Teaches you how to move your unique body in a range that is right for you. 
	Helps you to rediscover the pleasure of moving! 

If you are new to Bones for Life®, this is an excellent time to start! If you have taken classes before, we will be learning some new processes and revisiting a few favorites. Bones for Life® is designed to help anyone, and everyone, use natural movements to promote bone health and strength while possibly preventing osteoporosis.

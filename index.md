You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Join a Class with Liz in person or on Zoom

Bones for Life® processes help us to understand more about ourselves. When we begin to pay attention to our movement and feel more aware, the brain and nervous system make positive changes that create more efficiency. Movement becomes easier and more enjoyable. I believe you will feel a difference.

We begin our class with “Please lie on your back.” You will then be verbally guided through small and slow mindful movements to interpret in your own way without any demonstration. It allows you the time and space to be with yourself, without judgement, while becoming aware of unexpected and interesting connections within and between the movements. As you attend to improving the quality of your movement, unnecessary muscular tensions throughout the body can reorganize and release. Students are often amazed at the quick and clear changes that occur through the neuromuscular repatterning that happens in an Awareness Through Movement lesson! Unique to the Feldenkrais Method® of somatic education these lessons tie directly into functional movements of daily life, such as walking efficiently, safely lifting objects, and improving one’s posture in sitting or standing. 
You will need a comfortable surface to lie on that you will be able to slide on. A blanket or sleeping bag over a yoga mat for example. You might need a little support under your head. You’ll remove your shoes, glasses, and anything else on your body (watches, earrings etc.) This keeps your brain from having to consider anything else except your movement. This is not an exercise class but rather a somatic practice of movement re-education.

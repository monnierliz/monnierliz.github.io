You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Join a Class with Liz 

Finding your Footing Part 2!
A Bones for Life® four-class series August 11 – Sept 1, 2022, on ZOOM
August 11, 17 (a Wednesday), August 25 and September 1:  12 Noon -1:00 p.m. (EST) with Liz Monnier

Here are a few comments from people who participated in the first Finding Your Footing Series:
“I feel more balanced.”
“I feel more stable.”
“I am feeling connections.”
“I can’t describe how I feel, but it’s different and I like it.” 

 You can take control of yourself now by participating in a Bones for Life® class. Please feel free to share this invitation with friends and family who you think would benefit from this series of classes. 

 
Last month I taught a four-class series in Bones for Life® designed to improve stability, to gain more confidence with standing and walking and to practice some basic skills to reduce our chances of falling. As we approached the last class, I realized that there were many more processes we could experience, and we needed to review and practice what we had learned. So, voila, Finding your Footing Part 2. If you didn’t participate in Part 1, no worries, we will be learning new material and reviewing what we have learned. 

I hope you’ll join me this month as we explore and rediscover our self-reliance. For this series you will need a set of ankle weights.

With simple and gentle instruction, Bones for Life® processes can bring the following benefits: 

	Coordinates a springy and vibrant walk.
	Frees the joints from compromising habits allowing for pain free movement.
	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium. 
	Teaches you how to move your unique body in a range that is right for you. 
	Helps you to rediscover the pleasure of moving! 
Bones for Life® is designed to help anyone, and everyone, use natural movements to promote bone health and strength while possibly preventing osteoporosis. For more information check out this link: http://movementintelligence.org/bones-for-life

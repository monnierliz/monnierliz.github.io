You can’t love movement if it is difficult or painful. I hope that I can help you
rediscover the possibilities of movement through individual sessions or classes.

> “To make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant. Life
without movement is unthinkable.” - Moshe Feldenkrais

Upon leaving my long-time job as Artistic Director at the Fort Wayne Dance
Collective, I turned my attention to offering programs that help people reconnect to
their bodies and to find joy and comfort in movement. For some it means re-education on how to stand up, improve posture, recover from an injury, or how to
be a better swimmer. For others they look to movement to reduce stress.

We can start on a path of easier movement together.

Strengthening the Antigravity Axis
A Bones for Life® series for June 2022 with Liz Monnier
June 7, 14, 21, 28 Tuesday nights 6:00-7:00 p.m. (EST)

Antigravity Axis? What in the world is that? It’s a way of standing while being free from the force of gravity which is pulling on us every minute of every day. It’s another way of perceiving the idea of standing tall without using muscular force. Is it possible to line up our skeleton in such a perfect way that makes standing effortless? Well, I believe it is, but it’s a never-ending journey! 
I hope you’ll join me for the four Tuesday nights in June to upgrade our vertical alignment to stimulate bone strength through natural movement and weight-bearing postures. For this series you will need your Bones for Life® 7-yard fabric wrap, and one- or two-pound hand weights. (Or you can use ankle weights on your wrists.)

With simple and gentle instruction, Bones for Life® processes can bring the following benefits: 

	Coordinates a springy and vibrant walk.
	Frees the joints from compromising habits allowing for pain free movement.
	Stimulates bone strength. 
	Develops skills for restoring equilibrium. 
	Teaches you how to move your unique body in a range that is right for you. 
	Helps you to rediscover the pleasure of moving! 

If you are new to Bones for Life®, this is an excellent time to start! If you have taken classes before, we will be learning some new processes and revisiting a few favorites. Bones for Life® is designed to help anyone, and everyone, use natural movements to promote bone health and strength while possibly preventing osteoporosis. For more information check out this link: http://movementintelligence.org/bones-for-life/
So, let’s do this together! 

Online on Zoom
 4 Tuesdays in June 6:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. (EST)
June 7, 14, 21, 28
Classes will be recorded and available for two weeks. (Although recordings are not interactive, it does allow for flexibility for participation on your own time. I encourage you to do this if you are unable to make the Tuesday night class. )

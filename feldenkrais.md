Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais was a scientific engineer by trade and judo master by training. He had long suffered issues with his knees, but was intent on avoiding invasive options like surgery. 

He began to study anatomical structure, and many disciplines related to movement and human behavior, such as yoga, the martial arts, psychology, and education, especially the work of Jean Piaget. 

What interested him was the weight-bearing and shock-absorbing function of the skeletal system in relationship to gravity. He found that by gently stimulating the bones and joints and their connection through the spinal column and the brain, new movement patterns were possible. In other words, by learning to sense subtle differences, a person could learn to move out of pain. By engaging the brain’s ability to relearn and change, the [Feldenkrais Method®](https://feldenkrais.com/) improves the exchange of relevant information between the nervous system and the muscles, and as a result, movement becomes more comfortable. 

> “Liz is wonderful. She knows how the body works. Every time I have a session with her she helps me get my body back in balance.” —Sandy Gebhard 

This process of retraining the body is called somatic education in which the [Feldenkrais Method®](https://feldenkrais.com/) is rooted. By expanding the self-image through precise movement sequences, attention is brought to parts of the self that are not functioning efficiently. You can become more aware of your habitual neuromuscular patterns and rigidities and will be able to expand your options for moving in less painful ways. 

The benefits of the [Feldenkrais Method®](https://feldenkrais.com/) include greater ease and range of motion, improved flexibility and coordination, and more efficient movement. In short, by directed attention, the Feldenkrais Method® assists you to live your life more fully, efficiently and comfortably. 

## Private Sessions
_What to expect_

A private lesson, called Functional Integration®, is an individualized and personal encounter. The practitioner works with you to determine the best strategy for your situation. The lesson will relate to a specific desire, intention, or need. 

What makes Functional Integration® different from other modalities is that the learning process is manifested without the use of any invasive or forceful procedure. Taking into account your abilities, qualities, and integrity, the practitioner/ teacher creates an environment in which you can learn comfortably. 

Lessons take place with the student sitting or lying comfortably on a specially designed table. The practitioner uses gentle, non-invasive manipulations to stimulate connections with the nervous system. At times, the practitioner might incorporate various props to support your body configuration or to facilitate certain movements. The result of the session is improved alignment in daily activities like sitting, standing, and walking.

> “It was the most gentle, soothing, relaxing and most of all rewarding experience that my body has had in some time. Thank you, Liz, for a most amazing session. I’m so happy this is what you do, as you are wonderful!” — Sandy E’Bell

## Classes
_What to expect_

Awareness Through Movement® classes are verbally directed movement sequences presented primarily to groups. A lesson generally lasts from thirty to sixty minutes. Each lesson is organized around a particular function. Just like the private lessons, the group lessons consist of comfortable, easy movements that gradually evolve into movements of greater range and complexity. 

> "This is only my 4th session and the levels of awareness that have opened up for me this morning are just amazing!  I left the studio walking with a normal gait, looking straight ahead, both feet rolling through each step instead of the legs just randomly picking up and dropping each foot to the floor like rag doll legs." - Mary

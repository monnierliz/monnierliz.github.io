My mom says that at age four, I was marching with the bands on television. My
elementary school years were filled with dancing down hallways and putting on
plays for neighbor kids. I learned to do cartwheels in the aisles of grocery stores.

During the summer of 1978, having recently moved to Fort Wayne, IN, I befriended
several women who shared my love of dance and together we created the Fort
Wayne Dance Collective, which still thrives.

I enjoyed a career that brought me in touch with many forms of movement and
theatre including contact improvisation, the Bartenieff Movement Fundamentals®,
the Feldenkrais Method®, Action Theatre, Music Together®, and studied with
notable artists Joe Goode, Remy Charlip, Ruth Zaporah and many more.

My 37 years as Artistic Director of the Fort Wayne Dance Collective honed my skills
as a teacher, choreographer, performer, director, and administrator.

I left my administrative position at the Fort Wayne Dance Collective in 2015 which
coincided with my graduation from the Seattle Eastside Feldenkrais® Training.
Since then, I continue to teach a variety of classes as well as focusing on my
profession as a Feldenkrais® Practitioner. I am currently enrolled as a Teacher in
Training for Bones for Life® as administrated through Future Life Now.
